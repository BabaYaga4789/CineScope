// In a controller for maintaining a Watchlist for a user in Node,  you would typically need the following functions:

// getWatchlist: This function would retrieve the current watchlist for a given user.
const getWatchlist = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {};

// addToWatchlist: This function would add a new item to the user's watchlist.
const addToWatchlist = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {};

// removeFromWatchlist: This function would remove an item from the user's watchlist.
const removeFromWatchlist = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {};

// clearWatchlist: This function would remove all items from the user's watchlist.
const clearWatchlist = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {};

// updateWatchlist: This function would allow the user to update the details of an item in their watchlist, such as changing its name or description.
const updateWatchlist = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {};

// getWatchlistItem: This function would retrieve a specific item from the user's watchlist based on its ID.
const getWatchlistItem = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {};

// getWatchlistCount: This function would return the total number of items in the user's watchlist.
const getWatchlistCount = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {};

// These functions would allow you to create a basic Watchlist management system in your Node controller. You would also need to implement appropriate database queries or other storage mechanisms to save and retrieve the user's watchlist data
